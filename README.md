TOPSIS-Based Ranking of Pre-Trained Conversational Models

Overview

This project utilizes the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method to systematically rank pre-trained conversational AI models based on multiple performance criteria.

Dataset & Models

The following five pre-trained models are evaluated:
	•	GPT-3.5
	•	T5
	•	XLNet
	•	BERT
	•	DialoGPT

Each model is assessed using the following criteria:
	•	Accuracy (Higher is better)
	•	Perplexity (Lower is better)
	•	Response Time (Lower is better)
	•	BLEU Score (Higher is better)
	•	F1 Score (Higher is better)

Methodology

Normalization

Min-Max scaling is used to standardize values.

Weight Assignment

Each criterion is weighted based on significance.

TOPSIS Calculation
	•	Compute ideal best and ideal worst values.
	•	Determine Euclidean distances from ideal values.
	•	Compute TOPSIS scores to rank models.

Installation & Usage

Prerequisites

Ensure Python and the following dependencies are installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn

Execution

Run the script to compute model rankings and generate visualizations.

Results

The output ranks models based on TOPSIS scores. The final rankings are as follows:

Model	TOPSIS Score	Rank
GPT-3.5	0.679623	1
T5	0.657469	2
XLNet	0.404832	3
BERT	0.362986	4
DialoGPT	0.320377	5
